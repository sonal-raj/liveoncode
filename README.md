A plethora of general purpose code fragments and useful snippets for students and professionals.

=================================================================================================

Well, reliving code is writing the code again and again. But if you wrote 
the code once, whats the point in writing it again and again, when you can
create more and more beautiful and amazing stuff.

To relive and relieve code, I decided to put all my code segments, small or big,
trivial or important, C'd or Pythonised into this one repo, this code haven.
So, whether you are a student ot a professional coder, this is where you will 
get it all.

So, learn, share, push, pull, code more and improve this collection.
